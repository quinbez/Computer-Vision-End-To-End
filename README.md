# Computer-Vision-End-To-End
Computer vision is a field of study that focuses on enabling computers to understand and interpret visual data, such as images and videos. It involves various tasks, including image classification, object detection, image segmentation, and image generation.

In PyTorch, you can use built-in functionalities to facilitate training, testing, and validation. The torchvision package provides datasets and transforms for loading and preprocessing common computer vision datasets.
